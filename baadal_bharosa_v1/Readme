This is a beta version of the agent. Also included is a test furnace app showing how to output metric data for the agent

How to run the agent:
./agent --device test-device-1 -ca_certs roots.pem -private_key rsa_private.pem

How to run the furnace app:

python furnace.py

What to expect:
The furnace app should output a furnace fan or temperature metric randomnly every 5 seconds
The metric is written out as a uniquely named .json file in the same directory
The agent should read the json file, validate it, transmit the metric data over the network and delete the file

Sample output from furnace.py:

$ python test_app/furnace.py
